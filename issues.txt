USERS
- Need password encryption / md5 hash.

MAP
- Need to fix formatting when trying to print the map, the map is not fullscreen and it shows the search bar.

CONTAINERS
- Need to connect containers to orders (can't test this yet).
    -- This will be implimented with the orders changing stages, once a container is selected as delivered, the status will change.

CUSTOMERS

ORDERS
- Need print pages (2).
- Need a way to click the order and view it & update the stages.
    -- Have stage buttons on master list to make it quicker to change stages
        -- once button is clicked to chagne stages, go to form to fill in rest of required fields.
        -- return to masterlist with success message
    -- have a button in the view order form to change status doing the same as above.
