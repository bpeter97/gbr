Not sure how to fix:

 - Can't filter customers that are on other pages. CANNOT FIX WITH HOW IT IS CODED RIGHT NOW.

As of 11/2/2017:

CALENDAR
- None

CART
- None

USERS
- Need password encryption / md5 hash.

MAP
- Need to fix formatting when trying to print the map, the map is not fullscreen and it shows the search bar.

CONTAINERS
- Need to connect containers to orders (can't test this yet).
    -- This will be implimented with the orders changing stages, once a container is selected as delivered, the status will change.

CUSTOMERS
- None

QUOTES
- None

ORDERS
- Need print pages (2).
- Need a way to click the order and view it & update the stages.

    -- CAN UPGRADE FROM STAGE 1 TO STAGE 2
        -- Updates driver who delivered it
        -- Updates container location
        -- Updates container is_rented status
        -- Removes Delivery event from calendar
        -- Adds driver notes to order
        -- Creates a rental_history row

    -- have a button in the view order form to change status doing the same as above.

    -- Need a different view order info page once status goes from 1 to 2!
