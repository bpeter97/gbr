As of 11/2/2017:

CALENDAR
- None

CART
- None

USERS
- Need password encryption / md5 hash.

MAP
- Need to fix formatting when trying to print the map, the map is not fullscreen and it shows the search bar.

CONTAINERS
- Need to connect containers to orders (can't test this yet).
    -- This will be implimented with the orders changing stages, once a container is selected as delivered, the status will change.

CUSTOMERS
- None

QUOTES
- Need to create a way to transfer existing quote to a pre-made order form.
    -- Move to order form (including products)
    -- fill in rest of required fields (date, time, etc)
    -- ensure there is a hidden field posting data that it is coming form a quote
        -- if it is coming from quote, set status to quote as closed quote and create the order as normal.

ORDERS
- Need print pages (2).
- Need a way to click the order and view it & update the stages.
    -- Have stage buttons on master list to make it quicker to change stages
        -- once button is clicked to chagne stages, go to form to fill in rest of required fields.
        -- return to masterlist with success message
    -- have a button in the view order form to change status doing the same as above.
